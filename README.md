# VPTQ: Extreme Low-bit Vector Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models

## TL;DR

**Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ)** is a novel Post-Training Quantization method that leverages **Vector Quantization** to high accuracy on LLMs at an extremely low bit-width (<2-bit). 
VPTQ can compress 70B, even the 405B model, to 1-2 bits without retraining and maintain high accuracy.

* Better Accuracy on 1-2 bits, (405B @ <2bit, 70B @ 2bit)
* Lightweight Quantization Algorithm: only cost ~17 hours to quantize 405B Llama-3.1
* Agile Quantization Inference: low decode overhead, best throughput, and TTFT

**Example: Run Llama 3.1 70b on RTX4090 (24G @ ~2bits) in real time**

## [**Tech Report**](https://github.com/microsoft/VPTQ/blob/main/VPTQ_tech_report.pdf)

Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables.

### Early Results from Tech Report
VPTQ achieves better accuracy and higher throughput with lower quantization overhead across models of different sizes. The following experimental results are for reference only; VPTQ can achieve better outcomes under reasonable parameters, especially in terms of model accuracy and inference speed.

## Evaluation
### Models from Open Source Community

‚ö†Ô∏è The repository only provides a method of model quantization algorithm. 

‚ö†Ô∏è The open-source community [VPTQ-community](https://huggingface.co/VPTQ-community) provides models based on the technical report and quantization algorithm. 

‚ö†Ô∏è The repository cannot guarantee the performance of those models.


**Quick Estimation of Model Bitwidth (Excluding Codebook Overhead)**:
- **Model Naming Convention**: The model's name includes the **vector length** $v$, **codebook (lookup table) size**, and **residual codebook size**. For example, "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-v8-k65536-256-woft" and "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct", where:
  - **Vector Length**: 8
  - **Number of Centroids**: 65536 (2^16)
  - **Number of Residual Centroids**: 256 (2^8)
- **Equivalent Bitwidth Calculation**:
  - **Index**: log2(65536) = 16 / 8 = 2 bits
  - **Residual Index**: log2(256) = 8 / 8 = 1 bit
  - **Total Bitwidth**: 2 + 1 = 3 bits
- **Model Size Estimation**: 70B * 3 bits / 8 bits per Byte = 26.25 GB

- **Note**: This estimate does not include the size of the codebook (lookup table), other parameter overheads, and the padding overhead for storing indices. For the detailed calculation method, please refer to **Tech Report Appendix C.2**.

## Limitation of VPTQ
* ‚ö†Ô∏è VPTQ should only be used for research and experimental purposes. Further testing and validation are needed before you use it.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è The repository only provides a method of model quantization algorithm. The open-source community may provide models based on the technical report and quantization algorithm by themselves, but the repository cannot guarantee the performance of those models.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è VPTQ is not capable of testing all potential applications and domains, and VPTQ cannot guarantee the accuracy and effectiveness of VPTQ across other tasks or scenarios.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Our tests are all based on English texts; other languages are not included in the current testing.
