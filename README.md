# VPTQ: Extreme Low-bit Vector Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models

## TL;DR

**Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ)** is a novel Post-Training Quantization method that leverages **Vector Quantization** to high accuracy on LLMs at an extremely low bit-width (<2-bit). 
VPTQ can compress 70B, even the 405B model, to 1-2 bits without retraining and maintain high accuracy.

* Better Accuracy on 1-2 bits
* Lightweight Quantization Algorithm: only cost ~17 hours to quantize 405B Llama-3.1
* Agile Quantization Inference: low decode overhead, best throughput, and TTFT

## Details and [**Tech Report**](https://github.com/microsoft/VPTQ/blob/main/VPTQ_tech_report.pdf)

Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables.


## Early Results from Tech Report
VPTQ achieves better accuracy and higher throughput with lower quantization overhead across models of different sizes. The following experimental results are for reference only; VPTQ can achieve better outcomes under reasonable parameters, especially in terms of model accuracy and inference speed.

pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/VPTQ.git --no-build-isolation
```

### Language Generation
To generate text using the pre-trained model, you can use the following code snippet:

```python

```

Launching a chatbot:
Note that you must use a chat model for this to work

```python
python -m vptq --model=LLaMa-2-7b-chat-1.5b-vptq --chat
```
Using the Python API:

```python
import vptq
import transformers
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("LLaMa-2-7b-1.5bi-vptq")
m = vptq.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("LLaMa-2-7b-1.5bi-vptq", device_map='auto')

inputs = tokenizer("Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night", return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
out = m.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100, pad_token_id=2)
print(tokenizer.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### Gradio app example
A environment variable is available to control share link or not. 
`export SHARE_LINK=1`
```
python -m vptq.app
```

## Acknowledgement

* We thank for **James Hensman** for his crucial insights into the error analysis related to Vector Quantization (VQ), and his comments on LLMs evaluation are invaluable to this research.
* We are deeply grateful for the inspiration provided by the papers QUIP, QUIP#, GPTVQ, AQLM, WoodFisher, GPTQ, and OBC.

## Limitation of VPTQ
* ⚠️ VPTQ should only be used for research and experimental purposes. Further testing and validation are needed before you use it.
* ⚠️ The repository only provides a method of model quantization algorithm. The open-source community may provide models based on the technical report and quantization algorithm by themselves, but the repository project cannot guarantee the performance of those models.
* ⚠️ VPTQ is not capable of testing all potential applications and domains, and VPTQ cannot guarantee the accuracy and effectiveness of VPTQ across other tasks or scenarios.
* ⚠️ Our tests are all based on English texts; other languages are not included in the current testing.
