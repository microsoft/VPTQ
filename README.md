# VPTQ: Extreme Low-bit Vector Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models

## TL;DR

**Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ)** is a novel Post-Training Quantization method that leverages **Vector Quantization** to high accuracy on LLMs at an extremely low bit-width (<2-bit). 
VPTQ can compress 70B, even the 405B model, to 1-2 bits without retraining and maintain high accuracy.

* Better Accuracy on 1-2 bits
* Lightweight Quantization Algorithm: only cost ~17 hours to quantize 405B Llama-3.1
* Agile Quantization Inference: low decode overhead, best throughput, and TTFT

## [**Tech Report**](https://github.com/microsoft/VPTQ/blob/main/VPTQ_tech_report.pdf)

Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables.

### Early Results from Tech Report
VPTQ achieves better accuracy and higher throughput with lower quantization overhead across models of different sizes. The following experimental results are for reference only; VPTQ can achieve better outcomes under reasonable parameters, especially in terms of model accuracy and inference speed.

### Models from Open Source Community

‚ö†Ô∏è The repository only provides a method of model quantization algorithm. 

‚ö†Ô∏è The open-source community [VPTQ-community](https://huggingface.co/VPTQ-community) provides models based on the technical report and quantization algorithm. 

‚ö†Ô∏è The repository cannot guarantee the performance of those models.

The model [*VPTQ-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-v8-k32768-0-woft*](https://huggingface.co/VPTQ-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-v8-k32768-0-woft) (~1.875 bit) is provided by open source community. The repository cannot guarantee the performance of those models.

```python
python -m vptq --model=VPTQ-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-v8-k32768-0-woft --prompt="Explain: Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night"

## Limitation of VPTQ
* ‚ö†Ô∏è VPTQ should only be used for research and experimental purposes. Further testing and validation are needed before you use it.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è The repository only provides a method of model quantization algorithm. The open-source community may provide models based on the technical report and quantization algorithm by themselves, but the repository cannot guarantee the performance of those models.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è VPTQ is not capable of testing all potential applications and domains, and VPTQ cannot guarantee the accuracy and effectiveness of VPTQ across other tasks or scenarios.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Our tests are all based on English texts; other languages are not included in the current testing.
